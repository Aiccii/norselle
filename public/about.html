<h1>Who Am I?</h1>

<h3>Born and Raised In Ras Al Khaimah, United Arab Emirates</h3>
<h4>My Passion for technology started when i was 11 years old,
    my father brought his telephone a blackberry and i was amazed with it,
    that piece of technology was something i never saw in my 11 years of life,
    from that day onwards i was always interested in how technologies work and what makes them work</h4>
